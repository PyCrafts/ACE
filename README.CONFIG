ACE Configuration README
========================

ACE configuration settings are stored in multiple ini-format files in the
SAQ_HOME/etc directory. The files are loaded in a certian order (detailed
below). Each time another configuration file is loaded, any settings it defines
overrides the settings defined in previous files.

Load Order (Normal)
===================

1) etc/saq.default.ini
2) etc/saq.integrations.default.ini
3) etc/saq.integrations.ini (if it exists)
4) default integration files as configured in etc/saq.integrations.ini
   typically these are saq.INTEGRATION_NAME.default.ini where INTEGRATION_NAME
   is the name of the integration
5) local integration files as configured in etc/saq.integrations.ini (if they exist)
   typically these are saq.INTEGRATION_NAME..ini where INTEGRATION_NAME is the
   name of the integration
6) configuration files specified on the command line
7) configuration files specified in the SAQ_CONFIG_PATHS environment variable
8) etc/saq.ini

Load Order (Unit Testing)
=========================
1) etc/saq.default.ini
2) etc/saq.integrations.default.ini
3) etc/saq.integrations.ini (if it exists)
4) default integration files as configured in etc/saq.integrations.ini
   typically these are saq.INTEGRATION_NAME.default.ini where INTEGRATION_NAME
   is the name of the integration
5) local integration files as configured in etc/saq.integrations.ini (if they exist)
   typically these are saq.INTEGRATION_NAME..ini where INTEGRATION_NAME is the
   name of the integration
