# Alerts

In ACE an *alert* is a [Root Analysis](root_analysis.md) object that satisfies one of the two following conditions.

1. It was submitted to ACE in `correlation` [analysis mode](analysis_modes.md).
2. It was promoted during analysis when one or more [Detection Points](detection_points.md) were added.

Alerts show up to the analysts in the GUI for review.
