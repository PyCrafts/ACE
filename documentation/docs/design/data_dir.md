# Data Directory

The ACE *data directory* is a sub directory contained inside the ACE [installation directory](saq_home.md) that contains all of the persistent data files that ACE uses locally. The location of this directory (relative to the installation directory) is defined in the [configuration](configuration.md) under the `[global]` section as `data_dir`.

By default this is set to `data`.
