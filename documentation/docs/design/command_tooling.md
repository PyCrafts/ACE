# ACE Command

The `ace` command sits in the [installation directory](saq_home.md) of ACE and it used to start, stop, configuration and manage the system.

The command uses the sub-command pattern. The format of most commands is

```bash
ace [options] sub-command [options]
```

Every command supports the `--help` option.
