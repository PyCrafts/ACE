# Directives

A *directive* is an additional analysis instruction given to an [observable](observable.md). Directives are used by [analysis modules](analysis_module.md) to control how they are treated by the analysis module.

An observable can have zero or more directives.

ACE has a number of built-in directives specified in the `saq/constants.py` file.
