# Integrations

An integration is a grouping of [configuration](configuration.md) data that enables some kind of extra functionality that does not exist in the base system. You can enable and disable an integration which enables and disables anything that is a part of that integration such as [analyis modules](analysis_module.md) or [collectors](collector.md).

See the [admin guide](../admin/integration.md) for details on how to manage integrations.
