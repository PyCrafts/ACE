# Disposition of Alerts

A disposition is the final assessment of an [alert](alerts.md) by an analyst. The value can be changed multiple times. Each time the disposition value changes the [alert](alerts.md) is re-analyzed by the [engine](engine.md) allowing for further correlation based on the new value.

See the [user guide](../user/disposition.md) for a detailed explanation of the base dispositions.
